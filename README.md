## Project Overview
This project explores the evolution of filmmaking across four decades (1980s-2010s) by analyzing key aspects of films released during that time. The analysis focuses on:

- **Diversity in Filmmaking**: Examining the representation of women in film production (cast and crew) and how it correlates with box office performance.
  
- **Box Office Performance and Awards**: Analyzing financial success and recognition of films over time.

- **Release Seasonality**: Investigating how the timing of releases (by month or season) affects film ratings.

- **Genre Trends and Film Durations**: Identifying changes in genre popularity and film length, and their influence on critical reception.

## Research Questions

### Diversity in Filmmaking
