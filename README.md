## Project Description
This project aims to investigate the evolution of filmmaking over four decades (1980s-2010s) by analyzing various aspects of films released during that time. Key areas of focus will include:

- **Diversity in Filmmaking**: Understanding the evolution of female representation in film production (cast and crew) from 1980 to 2017, including average percentages by decade and correlations with box office revenues.
  
- **Box Office Performance and Award Distribution**: Evaluating financial success and recognition of films, analyzing correlations between revenue, ratings, and awards.
  
- **Seasonality of Releases**: Investigating when high-rated films are typically released and how release timing affects ratings.
  
- **Trends in Genres and Film Duration**: Examining changes in genre popularity and average film length over the decades and their impact on critical reception.

## Research Questions
The following research questions will guide our analysis:

### Diversity in Filmmaking
- How has the proportion of women involved in film production (cast and crew) evolved from 1980 to 2017?
- How does the percentage of women involved in film production correlate with box office revenues?

### Box Office Performance and Award Distribution
- What are the average box office film revenues in each decade, and how do these revenues correlate with critical ratings?
- Which decade saw the highest number of awards distributed, and what key factors influenced award-winning likelihood?

### Seasonality of Releases
- In which months or seasons do higher-rated films tend to be released each decade?
- How does the frequency of film releases vary, and how do ratings compare between films released during peak versus off-peak months?

### Trends in Genres and Film Duration
- How have the popularity and diversity of film genres evolved from the 1980s to the 2010s?
- What trends in average runtime are observable over this period, and is there a correlation between genre popularity and film duration?
- How do genre and film duration relate to film ratings and critical acclaim?
