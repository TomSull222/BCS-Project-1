Project Description/Outline:
This project aims to investigate the evolution of filmmaking over four decades (1980s-2010s) by analyzing various aspects of films released during that time. Key areas of focus will include:


-Diversity in Filmmaking: Understanding representation by gender in lead roles and behind-the-scenes roles such as directors.


-Box Office Performance and Award Distribution: Evaluating financial success and recognition of films, analyzing correlations between revenue, ratings, and awards.


-Seasonality of Releases: Investigating when high-rated films are typically released and how release timing affects ratings.


Trends in Genres and Film Duration: Examining changes in genre popularity and average film length over the decades and their impact on critical reception.



Research Questions to Answer:
(may need to be reformulated/expanded)


Diversity in Filmmaking:

How has gender representation in lead roles evolved across decades?
Which decade had the highest representation of female directors and lead actors, and how did this correlate with film ratings and critical acclaim?


Box Office Performance and Award Distribution:

What are the average box office film revenues in each decade, and how do these revenues correlate with critical ratings?
Which decade saw the highest number of awards distributed, and what key factors influenced award-winning likelihood?


Seasonality of Releases:

In which months or seasons do higher-rated films tend to be released each decade?
How does the frequency of film releases vary, and how do ratings compare between films released during peak versus off-peak months?


Trends in Genres and Film Duration:

How have the popularity and diversity of film genres evolved from the 1980s to the 2010s?
What trends in average runtime are observable over this period, and is there a correlation between genre popularity and film duration?
How do genre and film duration relate to film ratings and critical acclaim?
